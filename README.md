# Stock price bar chart race
This is a fun project to see how the stock prices of Indian companies move over the years. 

In this we take the stock prices from January 2011 to June 2021. Calculate the cumulative percentage changes from the start date and try to plot it in a race bar chart.

For downloading and preparing the data plase see the ```prepare_data.ipynb``` notebook
